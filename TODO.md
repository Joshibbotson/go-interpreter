Go notes:
Slice: An array has a fixed size, a slice has a dynamic size and is a flexible view into the elements of an array.

Map lookup: in Go return a value and whether or not that key exists in the map:
value, ok := map[key]

for: Similar to a while loop in typescript you can use multiple conditionals to interate.
